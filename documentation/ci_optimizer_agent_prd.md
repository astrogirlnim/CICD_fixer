# CI Optimizer Agent ‚Äì Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Problem Statement & Goals

Modern CI pipelines are critical to software delivery, but are often slow, unreliable, and difficult to optimize. Developers waste time debugging YAML errors, waiting on sequential jobs, and manually tuning caching or parallelism. The CI Optimizer Agent is an AI-powered CLI tool that automatically analyzes and fixes CI pipeline configurations (starting with GitHub Actions), making them faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It is designed for both local (githooks) and CI pipeline invocation, with a focus on actionable, safe, and explainable optimizations.

**Goals:**
- Reduce CI pipeline failures and flakiness
- Shorten pipeline duration and feedback cycles
- Lower compute costs via optimal job structure and caching
- Minimize manual CI maintenance for developers

---

## 2. Personas & Stakeholders

- **Developers:** Want fast, reliable CI with minimal manual tuning
- **DevOps Engineers:** Need to enforce best practices and reduce CI support burden
- **Engineering Managers:** Care about team productivity, cost, and delivery speed
- **Open Source Maintainers:** Want to ensure contributor PRs don‚Äôt break CI

---

## 3. Scope (In/Out)

**In Scope (MVP):**
- GitHub Actions support (YAML workflows)
- Local invocation (pre-commit, pre-push githooks)
- CI pipeline invocation (as a step)
- CLI tool (stateless, no daemon)
- External LLM/knowledge base integration (with redaction)
- Configurable via file and CLI flags

**Out of Scope (MVP):**
- Other CI platforms (GitLab, CircleCI, etc.)
- Long-running server/daemon/API
- PR creation for fixes (future phase)
- HTML/JSON/PR comment reporting (future phase)

---

## 4. Core Use Cases (MVP)

1. **Auto-fix common YAML errors & schema violations**
   - Indentation, invalid keys, misused actions
2. **Suggest/auto-fix caching strategies**
   - Missing restore-keys, suboptimal cache paths
3. **Convert sequential jobs to parallel (where possible)**
   - DAG analysis, dependency inference
4. **Reorder test steps for optimal cache re-use**
   - E.g., move dependency install before test runs

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

- Analyze `.github/workflows/*.yml` for issues and optimization opportunities
- Detect and auto-fix YAML syntax/schema errors
- Suggest or auto-fix caching strategies
- Analyze job dependencies and parallelize where safe
- Reorder steps for cache efficiency
- Redact secrets/tokens before sending to LLMs
- CLI output: show suggestions, diffs, and explanations
- Support both suggestion (default) and auto-fix modes (flag/env/config)
- Configurable via `.cicd-fixer.yml` and CLI flags
- Exit with nonzero code on fatal errors

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** <5s runtime locally, <60s in CI (target)
- **Reliability:** <5% false positive rate on autofixes (target)
- **Security:** Never transmit secrets/tokens; redact before LLM calls
- **Extensibility:** Modular design for future CI platforms and fixers
- **Usability:** Clear CLI UX, actionable logs, safe by default

---

## 7. User Experience & Output

- **Invocation:**
  - Local: via githooks (pre-commit, pre-push)
  - CI: as a pipeline step (e.g., `run: ./ci-agent check`)
- **Modes:**
  - Suggestion (default): Show diff, ask for confirmation (local), or require opt-in (CI)
  - Auto-fix: Apply fixes directly (flag/env/config)
- **Output:**
  - CLI stdout: issues found, suggested fixes, diffs, explanations
  - Exit code: 0 (success), 1 (issues found), >1 (fatal error)

---

## 8. Configuration

- **Config file:** `.cicd-fixer.yml` (YAML)
  - Options: enable/disable auto-fix, file exclusions, LLM usage, etc.
- **CLI flags:** Override config file options
- **Environment variables:** For CI integration (e.g., `CICD_FIXER_AUTOFIX=true`)

---

## 9. KPIs & Success Metrics

- Mean pipeline duration (reduction)
- Pipeline success rate (increase)
- Flake rate (reduction)
- Total compute minutes (cost proxy)
- Mean time to fix CI issues
- User adoption/engagement (CLI invocations)

---

## 10. Roadmap & Timeline

- **MVP (2 weeks):**
  - CLI, GitHub Actions support, 3‚Äì4 core fixes, config file, suggestion/auto-fix modes
- **Alpha (Week 3‚Äì4):**
  - Feedback cycle, bug fixes, usability improvements
- **Beta (Week 5‚Äì6):**
  - Extend to GitLab, add PR mode, richer reporting

---

## 11. Open Source & Licensing

- License: MIT or Apache 2.0 (TBD)
- Modular plugin design for community contributions

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

- CLI tool runs locally and in CI, analyzing `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Detects and suggests (or auto-fixes) YAML errors, caching, parallelism, and step order
- Redacts secrets/tokens before LLM calls
- Configurable via file and CLI flags
- Outputs actionable suggestions and diffs to CLI stdout
- Passes internal test suite and real-world repo trials
