# CI Optimizer Agent – MVP Development Checklist

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅
Criteria: Essential systems that the application cannot function without. These are the building blocks that enable all other functionality.

[x] CLI Bootstrap
  [x] Initialize CLI with argparse or Typer (independent - no dependencies)
  [x] Implement version flag and help output (independent - no dependencies)

[x] Config Loader
  [x] Parse `.cicd-fixer.yml` file and load values into config object (independent - no dependencies)
  [x] Add support for CLI flags to override config file values (independent - no dependencies)
  [x] Add support for environment variables (e.g. `CICD_FIXER_AUTOFIX`) (independent - no dependencies)

[x] File Loader
  [x] Recursively collect `.yml` files from `.github/workflows/` (independent - no dependencies)

[x] Secrets Redactor
  [x] Detect and redact secrets/tokens in workflow files before external calls (independent - no dependencies)

---

## Phase 2: Data Layer ✅
Criteria: Systems for storing, retrieving, and managing application data. Each feature handles a specific type of data or storage mechanism.

[x] YAML Parser
  [x] Load and validate YAML structure (depends on File Loader)
  [x] Identify schema violations and invalid keys (depends on YAML Parser)

[x] DAG Analyzer
  [x] Parse job dependencies and build internal DAG (depends on YAML Parser)

[x] Caching Strategy Analyzer
  [x] Identify presence or absence of caching keys (depends on YAML Parser)
  [x] Detect suboptimal cache paths or patterns (depends on YAML Parser)

---

## Phase 3: Interface Layer ✅
Criteria: Components and interactions for users. Each feature represents a distinct interface element or user journey.

[x] Suggestion Output (Default Mode)
  [x] Print actionable issues with line numbers and explanations to CLI stdout (depends on YAML Parser)
  [x] Show patch-like diffs to CLI (depends on auto-fix logic)

[x] Auto-Fix Output (Optional Mode)
  [x] Apply changes in-place with clear CLI logs (depends on fixers and config)
  [x] Non-interactive mode with --yes flag to avoid hanging

[x] Exit Codes
  [x] Return 0 on success, 1 on issues, >1 on fatal error (depends on YAML Parser and Fixer Outcomes)

---

## Phase 4: Implementation Layer ✅
Criteria: Application functionality that delivers value. Each feature handles a specific capability.

[x] YAML Fixer
  [x] Auto-fix indentation errors and invalid keys (depends on YAML Parser)
  [x] Fix tabs to spaces, trailing whitespace, common typos
  [x] Ensure schema-compliant workflows (depends on YAML Parser)

[x] Caching Optimizer
  [x] Suggest restore-keys if missing (depends on Caching Strategy Analyzer)
  [x] Optimize path usage for caching (depends on Caching Strategy Analyzer)
  [x] Generate cache configurations for common package managers

[x] Job Parallelizer
  [x] Identify jobs that can safely run in parallel (depends on DAG Analyzer)
  [x] Inject `needs:` keys or remove unnecessary dependencies (depends on DAG Analyzer)
  [x] Build dependency graphs and analyze optimization opportunities

[x] Step Reorderer
  [x] Move dependency installation steps earlier (depends on YAML Parser)
  [x] Reorder for cache optimization (depends on Caching Strategy Analyzer)
  [x] Categorize and reorder steps for optimal execution

---

## Acceptance Tests
[ ] Test on real-world repositories (depends on all functional features)
  [ ] Validate false positive rate <5% (acceptance criteria)
  [ ] Validate performance target: <5s local, <60s CI (acceptance criteria)

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Successfully Implemented Features

**Core Architecture:**
- Modular design with separate analyzers, fixers, and output handlers
- Rich CLI interface with Typer framework
- Configuration management with Pydantic models
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Key Components:**
- **CLI Entry Point** (`ci-agent/cli/cli_entry.py`): Full CLI with --yes flag for non-interactive mode
- **Main Agent** (`ci-agent/agent/main.py`): Orchestrates the entire optimization process
- **File Loader** (`ci-agent/agent/file_loader.py`): Discovers and loads workflow files
- **YAML Parser** (`ci-agent/agent/parsers/yaml_parser.py`): Parses and validates YAML syntax
- **DAG Analyzer** (`ci-agent/agent/analyzers/dag_analyzer.py`): Analyzes job dependencies
- **Caching Analyzer** (`ci-agent/agent/analyzers/caching_analyzer.py`): Identifies caching opportunities
- **YAML Fixer** (`ci-agent/agent/fixers/yaml_fixer.py`): Fixes syntax issues, typos, formatting
- **Autofix Handler** (`ci-agent/agent/output/autofix_handler.py`): Applies fixes with backup creation

**Successfully Fixed Issues:**
1. ✅ **Hanging in Interactive Mode**: Added `--yes` flag for non-interactive autofix
2. ✅ **Duplicate Fix Application**: Consolidated fixes by type to avoid redundancy
3. ✅ **Sequential Fix Failures**: Fixed content updating between sequential fixes
4. ✅ **Typo Detection and Fixing**: Successfully fixes GitHub Actions typos (run-on → runs-on, need → needs)
5. ✅ **Trailing Whitespace**: Removes trailing spaces from all lines
6. ✅ **Tab to Space Conversion**: Converts tabs to 2-space indentation

**Testing Results:**
- Successfully processed sample workflow with 19 issues
- Consolidated from 19 duplicate fixes to 3 optimized fixes
- All typos correctly fixed: `run-on` → `runs-on`, `need` → `needs`
- Trailing whitespace removed from 15+ lines
- Tab characters properly converted to spaces

### 🔧 Firebase Configuration Considerations

**Current State:** No Firebase integration implemented yet.

**Potential Firebase Integration Points:**
- **Firestore**: Store workflow analysis results, optimization suggestions, and performance metrics
- **Cloud Functions**: Run CI optimization as serverless functions triggered by repository webhooks
- **Firebase Hosting**: Host web dashboard for visualization of CI metrics and optimization recommendations
- **Remote Config**: Dynamically update optimization rules and patterns without code changes
- **Analytics**: Track optimization effectiveness, common issues, and usage patterns

**Recommended Firebase Architecture:**
```
Firebase Project Structure:
├── Firestore Collections:
│   ├── repositories/ (repo metadata, configurations)
│   ├── analyses/ (optimization analysis results)
│   ├── metrics/ (performance tracking data)
│   └── rules/ (dynamic optimization rules)
├── Cloud Functions:
│   ├── analyzeWorkflow (triggered by GitHub webhooks)
│   ├── generateReport (scheduled batch processing)
│   └── updateRules (admin rule management)
└── Hosting: Dashboard for CI optimization insights
```
