# CI Optimizer Agent - Alpha Implementation Plan üöÄ

## üéØ Goal: Bridge the Gap Between Current MVP and Enhanced README Claims

This plan outlines how to implement the missing features that were originally claimed in the README but not yet built.

---

## üöß Phase Alpha-1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)

### 1. PyPI Packaging & CLI Simplification üì¶

**Current State:** Manual `python -m cli.cli_entry main` commands
**Target:** Simple `cicd-fixer` commands

**Implementation Tasks:**
```bash
# Target commands to implement:
cicd-fixer                    # Default analysis
cicd-fixer --autofix         # Auto-fix mode
cicd-fixer --file workflow.yml # Specific file
cicd-fixer --version         # Version info
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- [ ] **Setup.py/pyproject.toml Enhancement**
  - Configure proper entry points for `cicd-fixer` command
  - Add console scripts in `[project.scripts]`
  - Test local installation with `pip install -e .`

- [ ] **CLI Entry Point Refactoring**
  - Move `ci-agent/cli/cli_entry.py` to root-level package
  - Update import paths and module structure
  - Create unified `cicd_fixer.cli` module

- [ ] **Package Structure Reorganization**
  ```
  cicd_fixer/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py          # Simplified entry point
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent/               # Core logic (existing)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyzers/          # Move from agent/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixers/             # Move from agent/  
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ parsers/            # Move from agent/
  ```

- [ ] **PyPI Preparation**
  - Create proper package metadata
  - Add long description from README
  - Configure GitHub Actions for automated publishing
  - Test publish to TestPyPI first

### 2. Git Hooks Integration ü™ù

**Current State:** Manual command execution
**Target:** Automated git hook integration

**Implementation Tasks:**

- [ ] **Hook Installation Command**
  ```bash
  cicd-fixer install-hooks    # Install pre-commit/pre-push hooks
  cicd-fixer uninstall-hooks  # Remove hooks
  ```

- [ ] **Pre-commit Hook Implementation**
  - Create `hooks/pre-commit` template
  - Check only staged `.yml` files in `.github/workflows/`
  - Fast execution (<2s) for good developer experience
  - Option to bypass with `git commit --no-verify`

- [ ] **Pre-push Hook Implementation**
  - More comprehensive analysis before push
  - Include dependency graph analysis
  - Generate optimization suggestions

- [ ] **Hook Management Module**
  ```python
  # cicd_fixer/hooks/manager.py
  class GitHookManager:
      def install_hooks(self) -> bool
      def uninstall_hooks(self) -> bool
      def check_hook_status(self) -> dict
      def update_hooks(self) -> bool
  ```

### 3. Additional CLI Commands üñ•Ô∏è

**Target Commands:**
```bash
cicd-fixer check           # Alias for default analysis
cicd-fixer status          # Show optimization status
cicd-fixer config          # Show current configuration
cicd-fixer validate        # Validate configuration files
```

## ü§ñ Phase Alpha-2: AI/LLM Integration (3-4 weeks)

### 1. LLM Service Architecture üß†

**Current State:** Only configuration placeholders
**Target:** Full LLM integration with multiple providers

**Core Components:**

- [ ] **LLM Service Abstraction**
  ```python
  # cicd_fixer/services/llm/base.py
  class LLMService(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      async def analyze_workflow(self, workflow: str) -> LLMAnalysis
      
      @abstractmethod  
      async def suggest_optimization(self, context: dict) -> List[Suggestion]
      
      @abstractmethod
      async def explain_issue(self, issue: dict) -> str
  ```

- [ ] **Provider Implementations**
  ```python
  # cicd_fixer/services/llm/openai.py
  class OpenAIService(LLMService):
      # GPT-4 integration for workflow analysis
  
  # cicd_fixer/services/llm/anthropic.py  
  class AnthropicService(LLMService):
      # Claude integration
      
  # cicd_fixer/services/llm/local.py
